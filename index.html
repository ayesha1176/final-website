            <p class="subsectionTeg">Certainly! In the context of Code Craft Academy's teaching program for web
                development, "Web1," "Web2," and "Web3" may refer to different stages or modules within the curriculum,
                each focusing on specific aspects of web development. Here's an overview:
                <br>
                <br>

            <h3>Web1: Foundations of Web Development</h3>

            Content Covered: HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.
            Objective: Establish a solid understanding of fundamental web technologies. Students learn how to create
            static web pages, structure content with HTML, style pages with CSS, and introduce interactivity with basic
            JavaScript.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3> Web2: Front-End Development</h3>

            Content Covered: Advanced JavaScript, Front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js), Responsive
            Design.
            Objective: Dive deeper into front-end development, emphasizing modern JavaScript practices and popular
            frameworks. Students gain proficiency in building dynamic, interactive user interfaces and responsive
            designs for a seamless user experience across devices.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3> Web3: Back-End Development and Full-Stack Integration.</h3>

            Content Covered: Server-side programming (Node.js, Django, Flask, etc.), Databases (SQL and NoSQL), RESTful
            APIs, Full-Stack Development.
            Objective: Explore the server-side of web development, including database integration and server-side
            scripting. Students learn how to build robust back-end systems, create RESTful APIs, and connect them with
            the front-end, evolving into full-stack developers capable of handling end-to-end web application
            development.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>These three stages are designed to progressively build students' skills, starting with the basics and
